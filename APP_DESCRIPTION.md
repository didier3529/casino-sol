# Solana Casino - Provably Fair Gaming

Welcome to the Solana Casino, a fully decentralized gambling platform built on the Solana blockchain. Play classic casino games (Coin Flip, Dice Roll, Slots) with instant, provably fair results verified on-chain. Every bet, win, and payout is transparent and recorded on the blockchain—no house can cheat.

## What Makes Us Different
- **Instant Payouts**: Winnings are sent to your wallet immediately after each game
- **Provably Fair**: All random outcomes are generated and verified on-chain
- **Token Buyback & Burn**: Casino profits automatically buy back and burn our token via Pump.fun (bonding curve) or Jupiter (post-migration DEX), creating deflationary pressure and supporting token value
- **Low House Edge**: Fair odds with transparent rules (CoinFlip: 48% win rate, 1.96x payout; Dice: 2.78% win rate, 5x payout; Slots: 10% win rate, 10x payout)
- **No Registration**: Just connect your Solana wallet and play—no email, no KYC, no hassle
- **Live Leaderboard**: Compete with other players and see real-time rankings

## Games Available
- **CoinFlip**: Classic heads or tails with 1.96x multiplier
- **Dice**: Roll 2d6 and match your target (2-12) for 5x multiplier
- **Slots**: 3-reel slot machine with 10x multiplier for 3-of-a-kind

## Buyback & Burn System
Casino house profits are automatically used to buy back and burn the project token, reducing supply and supporting long-term token value. The system operates in two modes:
- **Pump.fun Mode**: During token launch (bonding curve phase), continuous buybacks every 10-15 seconds
- **Jupiter Mode**: After DEX migration, hourly buybacks aggregated across multiple DEXes for best prices

All buyback transactions are logged, transparent, and auditable on-chain.

Play responsibly and enjoy the future of decentralized gaming!
